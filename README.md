# WiFinder
is a user-driven website for finding free wifi networks(coffee shops, libraries etc) with the help of google maps. Networks are rated by users, submitted by users and the top rated review displayed first when viewing a network. The site also includes a download feature for offline usage which may come in handy if you're out traveling.
